# FOUC Prevention Verification

Use the included `verify-fouc-prevention.js` script to test if the FOUC prevention solution is working correctly.

## How to Use

1. Open your website in a browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox)
2. Open the browser developer tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Copy the contents of `verify-fouc-prevention.js` and paste it into the console
5. Press Enter to run the verification

## What It Tests

The verification script tests the following:

1. Whether the `loading` class is added to the HTML element during page load
2. If the FOUC prevention styles are properly injected
3. If any heroparallax images exist on the page
4. If any elements have heroparallax in their style attributes
5. If dynamically injected heroparallax images are properly blocked

## Interpreting Results

The script will output a detailed report with a series of checks, each marked with:

- ✅ - Passing (good)
- ❌ - Failing (needs attention)

At the end, it will provide an overall verdict on whether the FOUC prevention is working correctly.
