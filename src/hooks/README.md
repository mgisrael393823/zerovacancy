# Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks used throughout the application.

## Guidelines

- Each hook should have a specific, focused purpose
- Name hooks with the `use` prefix following React conventions
- Document parameters, return values, and usage examples
- Keep hooks small and composable
- Extract shared logic into custom hooks rather than duplicating
- Consider performance implications for hooks that run frequently
