# ZeroVacancy - React Hook Errors Fix Guide

This document explains how to fix the React hook errors that occur in the mobile version of the ZeroVacancy application.

## The Problem

The application is experiencing React hook errors, specifically:

```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
```

This typically occurs due to one of these issues:

1. **Multiple React Instances**: The application is loading multiple copies of React, causing hooks to fail.
2. **Invalid Hook Calls**: Hooks are being called outside of React function components.
3. **Component Initialization Issues**: The React component is being initialized incorrectly.

## The Solution

We've implemented several fixes:

1. **React Deduplication Script**: The `fix-react-deps.js` script ensures all dependencies use a consistent React version.
2. **Vite React Singleton Plugin**: The plugin enforces proper bundling of React to avoid duplicates.
3. **Function-based Manual Chunks**: The updated configuration ensures consistent React bundling.
4. **Loading Indicator Improvements**: The loading indicator now works without interfering with React initialization.

## How to Apply the Fix

### Automatic Fix

Run the fix script:

```bash
./fix-react-hooks.sh
```

This script will:
1. Apply React dependency overrides to package.json
2. Clean node_modules
3. Reinstall dependencies with the correct React configuration

### Manual Fix

If you prefer to fix the issue manually:

1. Run the React dependency fix script:
   ```bash
   node fix-react-deps.js
   ```

2. Clean your node_modules:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   ```

3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Verification

To verify the fix:

1. Check the browser console for React hook errors
2. Verify the mobile loading works correctly
3. Test the application on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Check for any browser extensions that might interfere with React
3. Try a different browser to isolate the issue
4. Run `npm ls react` to check for duplicate React packages

## Technical Details

The main fixes include:

1. **Package.json Overrides**: Ensuring all packages use the same React version
2. **Vite Configuration**: Using a function-based manual chunks configuration that properly handles React
3. **React Singleton Plugin**: A custom Vite plugin that ensures React is properly externalized
4. **Loading Indicator**: Simplified loading indicator that doesn't interfere with React initialization

These changes together ensure that only one copy of React is loaded, preventing hook errors.
