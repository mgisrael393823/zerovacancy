# Component Refactoring Status

## Current Status (as of March 26, 2025)

We've completed significant progress on refactoring the UI components into a more organized, nested directory structure. The refactoring follows a consistent pattern:

1. Each component is moved to its own directory
2. The directory contains the component file, index.ts export, and README.md with documentation
3. The original file location maintains backward compatibility through re-exports with @deprecated annotations

## Completed Categories

The following component categories have been successfully refactored:

- ✅ **Buttons**: All button components moved to dedicated directories
- ✅ **Form Components**: All input, form, and related components moved to appropriate directories
- ✅ **Feedback Components**: Toast, alert, banner and related components moved
- ✅ **Overlay Components**: Dialog, drawer, popover and related components moved
- ✅ **Media Components**: Avatar, carousel, and image components moved
- ✅ **Navigation Components**: Menus, tabs, and related components moved
- ✅ **Data Display Components**: Table, chart, and other display components moved
- ✅ **Animation Components**: Border effects, spotlights, and grid animations moved
- ✅ **Utility Components**: Badge, separator, and other utility components moved
- ✅ **Interaction Components**: Toggle, accordion, and collapsible components moved
- ✅ **Background Components**: Background effects and patterns moved to dedicated structure
- ✅ **Scroll Components**: Progress, to-top, and anchor components moved
- ✅ **Effects Components**: Parallax and magnetic effect components moved
- ✅ **Visualization Components**: Waves, pill rating, squares, and sparkles components moved
- ✅ **CTA Components**: Waitlist and creator waitlist CTAs moved

## Next Steps

The remaining components to refactor include:

1. **Demo/Example Components**:
   - button-3d-demo.tsx
   - button-3d-border-demo.tsx
   - button-3d-enhanced-demo.tsx
   - button-3d-physical-demo.tsx
   - ButtonStyleGuide.tsx
   - Consider creating a "demos" directory

4. **Documentation Review**:
   - Verify all READMEs are comprehensive with usage examples
   - Ensure all APIs are properly documented
   - Check for consistency across documentation

5. **Import Path Verification**:
   - Run full build test to verify all imports work correctly
   - Check for any circular dependencies
   - Verify backward compatibility

## Implementation Approach

Continue following the established pattern:

1. Identify related components to refactor as a group
2. Create appropriate directory structure
3. Move component implementations to new locations
4. Create index.ts files for proper exports
5. Add comprehensive README.md documentation
6. Add backward compatibility re-exports
7. Update COMPONENT-MOVEMENT-PLAN.md to track progress
8. Run build tests to verify changes
9. Commit changes with detailed commit messages

## Git Information

- Current branch: refactor/reorg
- Last commit: Refactored scroll and effects components to dedicated directories
- Commit hash: e87ec9a

## Additional Notes

- The project is a React/TypeScript application using a component-based architecture
- All component paths follow the pattern: @/components/ui/[category]/[component-name]/[component-name].tsx
- Each component directory should include README.md with proper documentation
- Barrel exports (index.ts) are used throughout the project for clean imports
- Backward compatibility is maintained through re-exports with @deprecated annotations
