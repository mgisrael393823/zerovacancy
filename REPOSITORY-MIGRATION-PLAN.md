# Zero Vacancy Repository Migration Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for restructuring the Zero Vacancy codebase into a more organized, maintainable architecture.

## Goals

1. Improve code organization with a logical, feature-based structure
2. Simplify navigation and discoverability
3. Enforce consistent patterns and conventions
4. Reduce technical debt
5. Enable easier onboarding for new developers
6. Support more efficient feature development

## Phase 1: Preparation (Current Phase)

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Create Documentation**: Define the new structure and conventions
   - [x] REPOSITORY-STRUCTURE.md
   - [x] DEPRECATED-COMPONENTS.md
   - [x] TESTING-STRATEGY.md

2. ✅ **Set Up Directory Structure**: Create the foundational directories
   - [x] Features directory with subdirectories for each feature
   - [x] Utilities and lib directories
   - [x] Configuration directory

3. ✅ **Create Migration Tools**: Build scripts to assist with the migration
   - [x] Import path updater (update-imports.js)
   - [x] Structure verification (verify-structure.js)

4. ✅ **Proof of Concept**: Migrate a small feature as a test case
   - [x] Creators feature as proof of concept
   - [x] Test the new structure and update scripts
   - [x] Verify backwards compatibility

### Next Steps

1. **Set Up CI Integration**: Add structure verification to CI pipeline
   - [ ] Add script to package.json
   - [ ] Configure CI to run verification on PRs
   - [ ] Add build verification

2. **Document Conventions**: Create developer guidelines
   - [ ] Coding standards document
   - [ ] File naming conventions
   - [ ] Import pattern standards
   - [ ] Component structure guidelines

## Phase 2: Clean Up (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Remove Deprecated Components**: Clean up unused code
   - [ ] Verify components in src/components/deprecated are not used
   - [ ] Remove deprecated components
   - [ ] Update imports as needed

2. **Consolidate Duplicate Functionality**: Identify and merge duplicate code
   - [ ] Scan for duplicate utility functions
   - [ ] Create centralized versions in the new structure
   - [ ] Update imports to use centralized versions

3. **Refactor Common Patterns**: Identify and standardize common patterns
   - [ ] Form handling patterns
   - [ ] Data fetching patterns
   - [ ] Error handling patterns

## Phase 3: Feature Migration (Weeks 3-6)

Migrate each feature in the following order:

1. **Auth Feature** (Week 3)
   - [ ] Migrate authentication components
   - [ ] Migrate auth hooks and utilities
   - [ ] Update imports in other files

2. **Blog Feature** (Week 4)
   - [ ] Migrate blog components
   - [ ] Migrate blog services and utilities
   - [ ] Update imports in other files

3. **Search Feature** (Week 5)
   - [ ] Migrate search components
   - [ ] Migrate search utilities
   - [ ] Update imports in other files

4. **Marketplace & Payments Features** (Week 6)
   - [ ] Migrate marketplace components
   - [ ] Migrate payment components
   - [ ] Update imports in other files

## Phase 4: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 7-8)

1. **Layouts and Page Structure** (Week 7)
   - [ ] Migrate layout components
   - [ ] Restructure page components
   - [ ] Update routing as needed

2. **Services and API Layer** (Week 8)
   - [ ] Refactor API service layer
   - [ ] Standardize data fetching and caching
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling

## Phase 5: Optimization and Refinement (Weeks 9-10)

1. **Performance Optimization** (Week 9)
   - [ ] Move performance utilities to new structure
   - [ ] Analyze and optimize bundle size
   - [ ] Implement code splitting improvements

2. **Documentation and Developer Experience** (Week 10)
   - [ ] Create component documentation
   - [ ] Update README files
   - [ ] Create developer onboarding guide

## Migration Process for Each Feature

Follow this process for each feature migration:

1. **Analysis**:
   - Identify all components related to the feature
   - Map dependencies between components
   - Identify shared utilities used by the feature

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - Create feature directory with appropriate subdirectories
   - Set up index exports for the feature

3. **Component Migration**:
   - Copy components to new location
   - Update imports within components
   - Create backward compatibility re-exports

4. **Testing**:
   - Run structure verification
   - Build the application
   - Test feature functionality
   - Verify visual consistency

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Update imports in other files referencing the feature
   - Document any migration issues or special cases

## Tools and Scripts

### Update Imports Script

The `scripts/update-imports.js` script automates updating import paths. Usage:

```bash
# Dry run to see changes without applying them
node scripts/update-imports.js --dry-run

# Apply changes
node scripts/update-imports.js
```

### Structure Verification Script

The `scripts/verify-structure.js` script ensures the codebase follows structural conventions. Usage:

```bash
node scripts/verify-structure.js
```

## Testing Strategy

See [TESTING-STRATEGY.md](./TESTING-STRATEGY.md) for detailed testing approach.
