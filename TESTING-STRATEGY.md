# Testing Strategy for Repository Restructuring

This document outlines the testing approach to ensure that functionality remains intact during the repository restructuring process.

## Test Types

### 1. Structural Tests

These tests verify that the repository follows the expected structure and conventions.

- **Directory Structure Verification**: Check that all expected directories exist
- **Import Pattern Verification**: Ensure correct import patterns are used
- **File Naming Convention Tests**: Validate that files follow naming conventions
- **Required Files Verification**: Check that all required files exist in feature directories

**Implementation**: Use the `verify-structure.js` script to run these tests.

### 2. Build Verification Tests

These tests ensure the application still builds correctly after changes.

- **Clean Build Test**: Build the application from scratch
- **Incremental Build Test**: Make small changes and verify incremental builds work
- **Production Build Test**: Verify production builds complete successfully

**Implementation**: Use the existing build scripts (`npm run build`, `npm run build:dev`).

### 3. Visual Regression Tests

These tests ensure the UI appears the same after refactoring.

- **Component Visual Tests**: Compare screenshots of major UI components
- **Page Visual Tests**: Compare screenshots of key pages
- **Responsive Visual Tests**: Test at multiple viewport sizes

**Implementation**: Manually capture screenshots before and after changes, or set up a visual testing tool like Percy.

### 4. Functional Tests

These tests verify that application features continue to work.

- **Navigation Flow Tests**: Verify routing and navigation works
- **Feature Functionality Tests**: Test key user workflows
- **API Integration Tests**: Verify API calls work correctly

**Implementation**: Create a test checklist for manual verification of key features.

## Testing Process

### Phase 1: Before Restructuring

1. **Baseline Testing**:
   - Run the full test suite to establish a baseline
   - Capture screenshots of key pages and components
   - Document API responses for key endpoints

### Phase 2: During Restructuring

1. **Per-Feature Testing**:
   - After restructuring each feature, run build verification
   - Verify the feature's visual appearance matches baseline
   - Test the feature's functionality
   
2. **Incremental Structure Verification**:
   - Run structure verification script after each major change
   - Fix any structural issues before proceeding

### Phase 3: After Restructuring

1. **Full Regression Testing**:
   - Run the complete test suite
   - Verify all visual components match baseline
   - Test all user workflows
   - Run structure verification on the entire codebase

2. **Production Verification**:
   - Create a staging deployment of the restructured codebase
   - Verify all functionality in a production-like environment
   - Check performance metrics to ensure no regressions

## Test Script: Feature Migration Checklist

For each feature being migrated, use this checklist:

```
[ ] Create new feature directory structure
[ ] Migrate core files (types, components, etc.)
[ ] Update imports in migrated files
[ ] Run structure verification script
[ ] Build application and fix any errors
[ ] Verify feature renders correctly
[ ] Test feature functionality
[ ] Update any imports in other files referencing this feature
[ ] Run build again to verify cross-feature compatibility
[ ] Document any issues encountered and their resolutions
```

## Testing Tools

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Structure verification script
   - Build scripts
   - ESLint for code quality

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Visual comparison
   - Functionality verification
   - Cross-browser testing

3. **CI Integration**:
   - Add structure verification to CI pipeline
   - Add build verification to CI pipeline
   - Consider adding visual regression tests to CI

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Import Path Issues**:
   - Check for typos in import paths
   - Verify the file exists at the specified path
   - Ensure proper use of `@/` prefix for absolute imports

2. **Build Failures**:
   - Check for missing exports
   - Verify circular dependencies haven't been introduced
   - Check for type errors

3. **Rendering Issues**:
   - Inspect component props passing
   - Check for CSS/style issues
   - Verify component mounting/unmounting

## Feature-Specific Test Cases

### Creators Feature

- Verify creator cards render correctly
- Test creator filtering and sorting
- Verify creator details page loads correctly
- Test creator search functionality

### Auth Feature

- Verify login/registration forms work
- Test authentication flows (login, logout, etc.)
- Verify protected routes redirect properly
- Test password reset functionality

### Blog Feature

- Verify blog posts list renders correctly
- Test blog post detail pages
- Verify blog categories and filtering
- Test blog search functionality

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures that the repository restructuring effort maintains the application's functionality while improving its organization. By following this approach, we can confidently refactor the codebase with minimal risk of regressions.
