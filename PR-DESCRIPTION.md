# Component Refactoring PR

## Overview

This PR reorganizes all UI components into a logical, nested directory structure to improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience. Instead of having all components in a flat directory, we've grouped them by functionality into categories and established a consistent pattern for component exports and documentation.

## Changes

- Reorganized **100+ UI components** into 16 logical categories
- Created consistent directory structure for all components:
  - `[category]/[component-name]/[component-name].tsx`
  - `[category]/[component-name]/index.ts`
  - `[category]/[component-name]/README.md`
- Added comprehensive documentation for all components
- Maintained backward compatibility with re-exports
- Added `@deprecated` JSDoc annotations to guide developers to new paths
- Updated component references to use proper paths

## Component Categories

- **Animations**: Border effects, spotlights, grid animations
- **Backgrounds**: Gradient, beams, warp, and wavy backgrounds
- **Buttons**: Various button styles (3D, border, physical, etc.)
- **CTA**: Call-to-action components for waitlists
- **Data Display**: Tables, progress, charts, calendars
- **Demos**: Button demos and style guides
- **Effects**: Parallax sections and magnetic interactions
- **Feedback**: Toasts, alerts, banners, cookie consent
- **Forms**: Inputs, checkboxes, selects, textareas
- **Interaction**: Toggles, accordions, collapsibles
- **Media**: Avatars, carousels, optimized images
- **Navigation**: Menus, tabs, breadcrumbs
- **Overlays**: Dialogs, drawers, popovers
- **Scroll**: Progress bars, scroll-to-top, section anchors
- **Utilities**: Badges, separators, visually hidden elements
- **Visualizations**: Waves, ratings, squares, sparkles

## Migration

This refactoring maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting components from their original locations, so existing code will continue to work without changes. However, developers are encouraged to update their imports to use the new paths.

Old pattern (still works but deprecated):
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

New pattern (recommended):
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/buttons";
```

## Documentation

- Added a top-level UI components README with organization details
- Created detailed README files for each component with:
  - Usage examples
  - Props documentation
  - Feature descriptions
  - Advanced usage patterns

## Testing

- Verified build succeeds with new component structure
- Verified backward compatibility with existing imports
- Checked for circular dependencies

## Future Improvements

- Gradually update existing component imports to use new paths
- Continue enhancing component documentation
- Standardize component APIs for better consistency
