# Performance Findings Report
Date: June 10, 2025

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Bundle Size Problems
Based on the production build output:

#### Largest Bundles (Critical)
1. **CategorySelector-BfkuEAMF.js**: 435.29 KB (133.97 KB gzipped) ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - This single component is larger than many entire applications
   - Likely includes heavy dependencies like a rich text editor or data visualization
   
2. **index-BMGkfIBV.js**: 418.56 KB (119.53 KB gzipped) ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Main application bundle is too large
   - Should be split into smaller chunks

3. **vendor-ui-CRh5FEe6.js**: 240.60 KB (77.21 KB gzipped) ⚠️ WARNING
   - UI library bundle is heavy
   - Consider tree-shaking or using lighter alternatives

4. **vendor-react-CjHHoTR7.js**: 141.88 KB (45.62 KB gzipped) ✓ Acceptable
   - React framework size is normal

#### CSS Issues
- **styles-6CPvx38-.css**: 254.79 KB (38.90 KB gzipped) ⚠️ WARNING
  - CSS bundle is quite large
  - Likely includes unused styles
  - Should implement CSS purging

### 2. Code Splitting Opportunities
Several components could benefit from lazy loading:
- BlogEditor (42.85 KB) - Only needed for admin users
- Pricing (34.15 KB) - Not needed on initial load
- Footer (27.78 KB) - Below the fold component
- Onboarding (19.29 KB) - Only for new users

### 3. FOUC Issues Still Present
Despite recent improvements:
- Loading class management is better but still visible flashes
- Font loading strategy needs refinement
- Critical CSS extraction not fully implemented

### 4. Image Optimization Status
- AVIF support added for icons ✓
- Creator content archived ✓
- Still need lazy loading for below-fold images
- Missing responsive image srcsets

## Recommendations for Codex Investigation

### Priority 1: Bundle Size Reduction
1. **CategorySelector Component**
   - Investigate what's making it 435KB
   - Likely candidates: TipTap editor, emoji picker, or data tables
   - Consider dynamic imports or lighter alternatives

2. **Main Bundle Split**
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Extract vendor dependencies properly
   - Use dynamic imports for heavy components

### Priority 2: FOUC Prevention
1. **Critical CSS Extraction**
   - Extract and inline above-fold CSS
   - Defer non-critical styles
   - Implement proper font-display strategies

2. **Font Loading**
   - Use font-display: swap consistently
   - Preload critical fonts
   - Implement fallback fonts that match metrics

### Priority 3: Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Implement Intersection Observer for images
   - Lazy load below-fold components
   - Progressive enhancement for features

2. **Resource Hints**
   - Add preconnect for external domains
   - Implement resource priorities
   - Use modulepreload for critical chunks

## Metrics to Monitor
- Initial JS payload: Currently ~850KB (too high, target <200KB)
- CSS payload: Currently 285KB (target <50KB)
- Time to Interactive: Likely >5s (target <3.5s)
- First Contentful Paint: Check with real devices
- Cumulative Layout Shift: Monitor with new changes

## Next Steps
1. Use Chrome DevTools Coverage tab to find unused code
2. Implement webpack-bundle-analyzer for detailed analysis
3. Set up performance budgets in CI/CD
4. Add real user monitoring (RUM) for production metrics
