# Frontend Performance Review - May 2025

This document summarizes a high level review of the ZeroVacancy frontend performance infrastructure and provides recommendations for further optimization.

## Bundle Analysis
- **Vite Visualizer**: Added optional `rollup-plugin-visualizer` integration. Run `npm run analyze:bundle` to generate `bundle-analysis.html` after a production build.
- Initial analysis indicates a large vendor chunk including React and Radix UI components. Consider further code splitting of rarely used UI modules.

## Critical Rendering Path
- Fonts are preconnected in `index.html`; keep using `font-display: swap`.
- Defer non-critical CSS through `loadCSSDeferred` in `performance-optimizations.ts`.
- Review hero images to ensure `fetchpriority="high"` and explicit dimensions to improve LCP.

## Component Performance
- `OptimizedImage` now forces `loading="eager"` when marked as a priority or LCP candidate to guarantee early fetching.
- Continue auditing large components for unnecessary re-renders and heavy effects.

## Asset Loading
- Use the existing image optimization scripts (`npm run optimize-images`) regularly.
- Audit unused assets with `npm run audit-assets` and archive them to keep the bundle lean.

## Mobile Performance
- The `useMobileOptimizations` hook sets viewport and reduces animation complexity. Ensure this hook loads on all mobile routes.
- Monitor INP on mobile devices via the `web-vitals.ts` utilities.

## Next Steps
1. Generate a bundle report and identify heavy dependencies.
2. Review CSS output from Tailwind and remove unused classes if possible.
3. Measure Web Vitals in production and track regressions.
